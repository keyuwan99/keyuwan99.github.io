Arrived at Harvard University [BIONICS LAB](https://bioniclab.seas.harvard.edu) and started working with Prof. Shriya Srinivasan on multimodal modeling and prediction of neuromuscular fatigue for intelligent control during functional electrical stimulation of a murine hindlimb. I am excited to build deep-learning models with physiology-informed features to predict fatigue and guide adaptive stimulation!
