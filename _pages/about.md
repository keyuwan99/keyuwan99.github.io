Hi! My name is Keyu Wan. I am a fourth-year undergrad at [Caltech](https://www.eas.caltech.edu)， majoring in Mechanical Engineering specializing in Robotics, and Control and Dynamic Systems (CDS). I am fortunate to work with Prof. [Aaron Ames](http://ames.caltech.edu), Prof. [Chiara Daraio](https://www.daraio.caltech.edu/daraio.html), Prof. [Mory Gharib](https://www.gharib.caltech.edu), and Prof. [Yuki Oka](https://www.okalab.caltech.edu) from Caltech, and Prof. [Shriya Srinivasan](https://bioniclab.seas.harvard.edu/person-page/) from Harvard.

My goal is to enable assistive robotics that restore human function and enhance mobility through the integration of physiological sensing, biomechanics, and intelligent control within a closed-loop framework.

You are welcomed to take a look at my **CV** [here](/assets/pdf/Resume_Keyu%20Wan.pdf).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
